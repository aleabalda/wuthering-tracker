# Wuthering Waves Tracker
A web app that allows users to track their daily, weekly, and event progress on the game Wuthering Waves.

## Features
1. Displays the time until the games daily reset
2. Displays a list for daily, weekly, and event tasks.
3. Tasks can be checked to show completion and are cleared once the daily reset timer reaches 0. (stored in local storage)

## Tools I used
To create this web app I used Vite, React with TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. Deployments are handled by Vercel and of course Git for version control.

## What I learned
Through the creation of this project I learned how to deal with timers using setInterval and useEffect.
I improved my use of TailwindCSS and adding extended customized CSS for fonts and images.
I managed state of the tasks with localStorage which was an easy and simple solution since there is no backend.
